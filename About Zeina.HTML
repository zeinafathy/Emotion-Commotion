  <h2>My Goals:</h2>

  
  <p class="my goals">My farthest goals in life are to be a faithful and grateful person. To be full of experience, skills and knowledge. To be fit and has a good physical and mental health. Having successful and healthy relationships with people. My routine nowadays to achieve a part of these goals, is that I go to the gym, I join the programs that I’m excited to in order to collect experience for applying for a college admission. I have Quraan sessions. I get out with my friends. I help my mother with the cooking and I sometimes study with my little brother. </p>
  
 
  
  <h2>My Values:</h2>

  
  <div>
    <p class="my values">There was a period in my life in which I decided to sacrifice all my time just for my future and my career, I always ignored my feelings. I felt like I’m a machine and that if I kept like this I will be a slave for the capitalism as many people and that I will forget the humanity and principles. So, one of my very significant values is that humanity and healthy relationships come first, I won’t be happy if I became the most successful and the most famous in the world, but all alone. Another value or it may be kind of a goal that I’ll do my best to let my parents live happily in life and heaven, because they gave a lot for my siblings and me, so I feel like I wanna give them my life. </p>
