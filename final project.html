  <h3>What is the importance of mental health?</h3><br>



<p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.</p>
<br><br>
<p>It’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on many factors.  When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health. So, it’s significant to take care of your mental health just as much as the physical health.</p>

<h3>What are the reasons for the mental health disturbance in Generation Z?</h3><br>

<p>According to the American Psychological Association, nine out of 10 Gen Zers have experienced some type of mental health concern. Some of the reasons are:
  <br>1-	This generation has attended the covid-19 pandemic in their teenage, which was a factor in increasing load and depression.
  <br><br>2-	The increasingly social media development, that’ve led to the continuous comparison of these adolescents with bloggers showing only the amazing part of their life in front of people.
  <br><br>3-	The massive urbanization and the continuous horrible competition between different organizations to be always the best.

<p>They are three times as likely to deal with suicidal thoughts, depression, and addiction compared to the baby boomer generation. Most of them or the adolescents who cannot control the huge load put on them, are less productive because, simply, it’s what the perfectionism does.</p>
<br><br>



<h3>How to deal with this stress?</h3><br>


<p>First, you have to care about your brain healing as you care about your responsibilities. Being always in this cultural competition, has made us putting high expectations from ourselves ignoring our health and mind pureness. Nothing is going to be missed out if you relaxed some time or mentioned some of your day for your interests. Most of the researches done on this topic, have proved that people who stress themselves less do more achievements than those who spend 7/24 working.</p>
<br>
<p>Second, you have to know how to well-use the social media platforms. There’s no problem to compare yourself with the others to know what are your drops and work on them. But, this comparison has to be fair. You can compare yourself with your colleagues to learn new skills from them and acquire experience. You’re not supposed to watch bloggers all day, these videos have such no merit.
  <br> <br>These pieces of advice cannot include all the issues facing gen z, so we highly recommend therapy. It will be effectively a benefit for you.
