      <h2> Who are we? </h2>
      <p>Hey I’m Zeina Fathy , a rising junior who is interested in neuroscience, psychiatry and mental health. That’s why I felt passionate about making this website about mental stability in gen z. I hope it’s helpful for whoever’ve read it <3, 

I’m Basmala Elgebaly, I am interested in  mental health, and because I am a one  of Gen Z, and I know what we are going through and our constant need for help, I wanted to try to help them with the problems they face regarding their mental health, so I thought of creating this website to try to draw attention to us, Gen Z, and I hope you enjoy what you find in this. The website, I hope it will be as useful as possible <3 I hope you find the information and activities that we will present on this website useful. For more information, you can contact us at:
